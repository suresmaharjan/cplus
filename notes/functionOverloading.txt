Function Overloading is a feature of object oriented programming  where two or more  functions can have same name
but different parameters. When a function name is overloaded
with different jobs it is called function overloading.

in function overloading function name should be same but arguments should be different.

Unlike other programming languages, JavaScript Does not support Function Overloading.
